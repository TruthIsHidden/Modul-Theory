Modul Theory
_____________
-> A modul is the smallest independent unit with no inherent value by itself.
-> Relations define value, not moduls by themselves.
-> An Object, G, can be defined as the result of n moduls and their links.
   G = {m1 ~ m2 ~ m3 ... mn}, where ~ is the relation operator.
   If G = {a ~ b ~ c ... ~ n}, G = {a ~* n} (composite link)
-> P ~ Q means P relates to Q, and P(~)Q means relation OF P and Q.
-> -G is the inverse of an object G, such that if G = {a ~ b ~ c ... ~ n}, G = {a ~* n}, then -G = {n ~* a}.

Axioms / Statements:

1. Commutativity of relations:
   P ~ Q ≠ Q ~ P

2. Potential function p():
   p(P(~)Q) = p(Q(~~)P), where ~~ is the inverse relation operator.

3. Addition of objects:
   c = a + b
   c~* = (~*a) ∪ (~*b)
   ~*c = (~*a) ∪ (~*b)
   (where ∪ is UNION, ~*x means all relations to x, and x~* means all relations of x);

   p(a+b) = p(a) + p(b)

4. Uniqueness of objects by relations:
   If ~*a = ~*b AND a~* = b~*, then a = b

5. Composite links:
   If (a ~ b ~ ... ~ n), then (a ~* n)
   p(a(~*)b) = p(a(~)b(~) ... n)

6. Multiplication of objects (new axiom):
   Let G = {m1 ~ m2 ~ ... ~ mn} and G' = {m'1 ~ m'2 ~ ... ~ m'k}
   Define the product object G * G' as:

   a) Modules of the product:
      G * G' = { (mi, m'j) | i = 1..n, j = 1..k }
      (Total modules = n * k)

   b) Link formation:
      (mi, m'j) ~ (mr, m's) ⇔ (mi ~ mr in G) OR (m'j ~ m's in G')
      (Each new module links according to the relations of its parent modules)

   c) Potential:
      p(G * G') = p(G) * p(G')

   d) Properties:
      - Associative: (G * G') * G'' = G * (G' * G'')
      - Identity element: I = object with 1 module, such that G * I = G
      - Inverse compatibility: -(G * G') = (-G) * (-G')
