Modul Theory
_____________
-> A modul is the smallest independent unit with capacity to relate, and which whose relations define it and give it value.
-> Relations define value, not moduls by themselves.
-> An Object, G, can be defined as the result of n moduls and their links.
   G = {m1 ~ m2 ~ m3 ... mn}, where ~ is the relation operator.
   If G = {a ~ b ~ c ... ~ n}, G = {a ~* n} (composite link) [Note: Objects are often referred to as systems]
-> P ~ Q means P relates to Q, and P(~)Q means relation OF P and Q.
-> -G is the inverse of an object G, such that if G = {a ~ b ~ c ... ~ n}, G = {a ~* n}, then -G = {n ~* a}.
-> Commutative relations are defined as, P <~> Q.
   Not all relations are commutative relations but all commutative relations are relations, of the form.
   P <~> Q <-> (P ~ Q) AND (Q ~ P)

Axioms / Statements:

1. Commutativity of relations:
   P ~ Q ≠ Q ~ P

2. Potential function p():
   p(P( ~ )Q) = p(P( ~~ )Q), where ~~ is the inverse relation operator.

3. Addition of objects:
   c = a + b
   c~* = ( ~*a ) ∪ ( ~*b )
   ~*c = ( ~*a ) ∪ ( ~*b )
   (where ∪ is UNION, ~*x means all relations to x, and x~* means all relations of x);

   p(a+b) = p(a) + p(b)

4. Uniqueness of objects by relations:
   If ~*a = ~*b AND a~* = b~*, then a = b

5. Composite links:
   If (a ~ b ~ ... ~ n), then (a ~* n)
   p(a( ~* )b) = p(a( ~ )b( ~ ) ... n)
6. Multiplication of objects (new axiom):
   Let G = {m1 ~ m2 ~ ... ~ mn} and G' = {m'1 ~ m'2 ~ ... ~ m'k}
   Define the product object G * G' as:

   a) Modules of the product:
      G * G' = { (mi, m'j) | i = 1..n, j = 1..k }
      (Total modules = n * k)

   b) Link formation:
      (mi, m'j) ~ (mr, m's) ⇔ (mi ~ mr in G) OR (m'j ~ m's in G')
      (Each new module links according to the relations of its parent modules)

   c) Potential:
      p(G * G') = p(G) * p(G')

   d) Properties:
      - Associative: (G * G') * G'' = G * (G' * G'')
      - Identity element: I = object with 1 module, such that G * I = G
      - Inverse compatibility: -(G * G') = (-G) * (-G')
      - Each unit in each object can interact with multiple/any object in the other object, representing how when two systems merge, new links are formed freely.
7. Definition of p(), the potential function.

   p(G) = Σ [c₀(mi) × (Σ w(mi, mj)) / deg(mi)]
   
   Summed over all modules mi in G, where:

   Components:
   - c₀(mi) = Intrinsic capacity of module mi
     • Domain: c₀(mi) ∈ ℝ
     • Default: c₀(mi) = 1 for standard modules
   
   - w(mi, mj) = Weight of relation between mi and mj
     • For directed: w(mi ~ mj) + w(mj ~ mi) (count both directions)
     • For bidirectional: w(mi <~> mj) (count once)
     • Domain: w ∈ ℝ
     • Default: w = 1 for standard relations
   
   - deg(mi) = Degree of module mi (number of distinct modules mi connects to)
     • Bidirectional relations count as 1 connection
     • For isolated modules: deg(mi) = 0 → zero contribution
   
   Properties:
   a) Default: c₀(m) = 1, w = 1 for standard modules/relations
   
   b) Composite effect: c₀((m₁, m₂, ..., mₖ)) = c₀(m₁) × c₀(m₂) × ... × c₀(mₖ)
   
   c) Domain: c₀(m), w(mi, mj) ∈ ℝ
   
   d) Identity: I = {i} with self-loop → p(I) = 1
   
   e) Zero: Z = ∅ → p(Z) = 0
   
   f) Isolated modules contribute zero potential
   
   Interpretation:
   - c₀(m) > 0: constructive; c₀(m) = 0: neutral; c₀(m) < 0: destructive
   - w > 0: synergistic; w = 0: neutral; w < 0: antagonistic
   - Degree normalization prevents inflation in dense networks
   - p(G) = net relational capacity of system.
