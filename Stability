Stability of Systems
_____________________
Definitions ->
Existence of a system:
A system can exist only if the energy required to maintain its relational structure is provided internally or externally.
In the absence of external energy, a system tends toward a stable configuration.

Stable system:
A stable system is a configuration of a given system that can exist independently, requiring the minimum necessary potential to maintain its relational identity.

Energy:
For a system G, E(G) is defined as the minimum required potential at which G can exist as a stable system.
[A system cannot exist if p(G) < E(G) independently]
________________________
Axioms:
1.Unless externally supplied with energy, a non stable system (G) tends to achieve,
p(G) = E(G).
Therefore if p(G) becomes less than E(G) -the system ceases to exist(Unless external energy is supplied to prevent its collapse, such a system is called a deficient system.)
2.Offset Stability(or Sr) for a system G is defined as,
p(G)/E(G) {if Sr = 1, the system is stable}
Measure of Instability (Or ΔS) = |Sr - 1| [This only applies to systems of the same type(either all compared systems are unstable OR deficient), p(G) > E(G) OR p(G)< E(G)]
to compare the DEGREE of stability between two systems, their measure of instabilities are compared. The greater the measure the more "unstable" the system is.
