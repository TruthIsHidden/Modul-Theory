Existence of a system:
A system can exist only if the energy required to maintain its relational structure is provided internally or externally.
In the absence of external energy, a system tends toward a stable configuration.

Stable system:
A stable system is a configuration of a given system that can exist independently, requiring the minimum necessary potential to maintain its relational identity.

Energy:
For a system G, E(G) is defined as the minimum required potential at which G can exist as a stable system.
[A system cannot exist if p(G) < E(G)]
